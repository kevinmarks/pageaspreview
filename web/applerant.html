<h1>How Apple's iOS fragmentation problems distort design thinking</h1>
<p>As someone who uses both Android and iOS regularly, I'm getting increasingly frustrated by fragmentation. Oddly though, contrary to popular myth,it's not on my Android devices I see this, but on the iOS ones. I install a popular, well-funded application like Instagram  Flickr, or Circa on my iPad, but when I launch it 3/4 of the screen is black bars, with a teensy little app in the middle. Or I can choose to scale it up (without smoothing, so jagged pixels I have't seen since the 1990s reinforce the sense that I am doing something wrong by attempting to run this app here. Every affordance is pushing back at me, saying I'm doing it wrong.
<p>By contrast, on Android applications scale up to fill the space sensibly - buttons stay button sized, text and image areas expand well. Developers can add alternative layouts to better handle varying sizes, but if they don't things remain legible and touchable.
<p>The more pernicious aspect to this is the mental dichotomy that the iOS world leads our design thinking into. You're either on the held-in-one-hand phone, briefly standing somewhere, or you're sitting down on the sofa in the evening using your iPad (so big and heavy that you have to rest it on your knees very soon). Steve Jobs even brought out a sofa to sit on at the launch. This false 'mobile versus desktop' dichotomy even misled <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-ipads-not-mobile-2010-11">Mark Zuckerberg</a> when he said "iPad's not mobile, it's a computer."
<p>Meanwhile, nobody told Barnes and Noble, whose 7" Nook did so well that Amazon launched a Kindle range the same size, leading to the lovely Nexus 7 from Google and finally to the iPad Mini from Apple.
