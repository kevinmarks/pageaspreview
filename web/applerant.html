<h1>How Apple's iOS fragmentation problems distort design thinking</h1>
<p>As someone who uses both Android and iOS regularly, I'm getting increasingly frustrated by fragmentation. But it's not on my Android devices I see this, but on the iOS ones. I install a popular, well-funded application like Instagram, Flickr, or Circa on my iPad, but when I launch it 3/4 of the screen is black bars, with a teensy little app in the middle. Or I can choose to scale it up without smoothing, so jagged pixels I have't seen since the 1990s reinforce the sense that I am doing something wrong by attempting to run this app here. Every affordance is pushing back at me, saying I'm doing it wrong.
<p>By contrast, on Android applications scale up to fill the space sensibly - buttons stay button sized, text and image areas expand well. Developers can add alternative layouts to better handle varying sizes, but if they don't things remain legible and touchable.
<h3>One hand or on your knees?</h3>
<p>The more pernicious aspect to this is the artificial dichotomy that the iOS world leads our design thinking into. You're either on the held-in-one-hand phone, briefly standing somewhere, or you're sitting down in the evening using your iPad (so big and heavy that you have to rest it on your knees - Steve Jobs even brought out a sofa to sit on at the launch). This false 'mobile versus desktop' dichotomy even misled <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-ipads-not-mobile-2010-11">Mark Zuckerberg</a> when he said "iPad's not mobile, it's a computer." and at the Facebook Home Launch, a tablet version was said to be "months away".
<p>Meanwhile, nobody told Barnes and Noble, whose 7" Nook did so well that Amazon launched a Kindle range the same size, leading to the lovely Nexus 7 from Google and finally to the iPad Mini from Apple. This is the form factor, tested for years by paperback books, that makes one-handed long form reading comfortable. If you spend any time on public transit, being able to read standing up or in narrow bus seats is an obvious benefit. But the hermetically sealed company-coach commuters at Apple missed this for years.
<p>Steve Jobs even said you'd have to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/steve-jobs-no-small-ipad/">file down your fingers to use it</a>. The thing is, on iOS it does feel like that. The iPad sized apps have too-small buttons, the iPhone ones are too big if zoomed. There is no way for an app to know how big your finger is compared to the screen, let alone a website. 
<p>The supposed advantage of iOS is fewer sizes to design for, but now you need 12 different layouts to cope with the horizontal and vertical orientations of each device, and the general layout tools don't handle this as well as Android, requiring <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/08/pixels">complex updates.</a> <a href="http://blog.sqisland.com/2013/02/learning-ios-as-android-developer.html">Chiu-Ki Chan explains</a>
<h3>No App is an island</h3> 
<p>The other fragmentation problem on iOS are the missing links. Not in the evolutionary sense, but the ability to readily connect between applications using URLs, as we're used to on the web. Applications can't claim parts of a URL, only <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW18">a whole scheme.</a> As Apple says:<blockquote><p>If more than one third-party app registers to handle the same URL scheme, there is currently no process for determining which app will be given that scheme.</blockquote>
<p>On Android, any app can claim any scheme, host and path, and the OS will resolve as appropriate, giving you a choice if more than one possibility is available

<p>So each app ends up embedding webviews inside it rather than linking to a browser, fragmenting your web history.
